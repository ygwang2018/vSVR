The demo is our proposed new algorithm $\epsilon^*$-SVR for the concrete strength prediction
by using the 10-folder cross-validation methods.
The attached files are listed as:
1. the main file: case1concrete.R
2. the data set:Concrete_Data.xlsx
3. the file for HPC running: nusvr.sub
4. the results: concrete_Eps.csv, concrete_MAE.csv, concrete_Optimal.csv, concrete_RMSE.csv, and concrete_SVs.csv
