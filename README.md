#  ``A New Algorithm for Support Vector Regression With Automatic Selection of Hyperparameters'' (under review by IEEE-TNNLS R3)

The source codes for Section VII are uploaded in Folder ``Section VII'' and the source codes for Section VIII are uploaded in Folder ``Section VIII''.
Considering computational time, for $\epsilon$-SVR with grid search, we divided each outloop experiment for case 1 (concrete), case 2 (mg), and case 5 (qsar_aquatic_toxicity) in a sub-experiment.
